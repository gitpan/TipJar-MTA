TipJar/MTA version 0.14
=======================

An outgoing SMTP system. All messages live in their own files
under a directory that should be on a file system big enough to hold
everything.

We keep track of bad addresses, domains we failed to connect to,
and queued messages with connection problems by domain, in additional
files.  See the HISTORY section of the pod in the main module for
the full (and hopefully not growing too much more!) feature list.

Messages that receive 400-level error codes (temporary delivery
failure) will be retried at increasing random intervals for a
week.

use TipJar::MTA::queue to add messages for sending, or simply
link your properly formatted message into the working directory.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

or simply unpack it and refer to the directory with
Perl's -I command line option.

DEPENDENCIES

This module uses "dnsmx" from
the djbdns package (http://cr.yp.to/djbdns) for the lookups
at this time.  A Net::DNS version would be welcome.  The DNS
function is abstracted, in the dnsmx() function,
near the beginning of the module.
