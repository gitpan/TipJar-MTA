TipJar/MTA version 0.21
=======================

An outgoing SMTP system. All messages live in their own files
under a directory that should be on a file system big enough to hold
everything.

We keep track of bad addresses, domains we failed to connect to,
and queued messages with connection problems by domain, in additional
files.  See the HISTORY section of the pod in the main module for
the full (and hopefully not growing too much more!) feature list.

as of version 0.19 a %SMTProutes data structure is available
for per-domain routing or SMARTHOST specification, and the 'nodns'
use-line parameter will suppress the requirement for Net::DNS.

Messages that receive 400-level error codes (temporary delivery
failure) will be retried at increasing random intervals for a
week.

use TipJar::MTA::queue to add messages for sending, or simply
link your properly formatted message into the working directory,
or link your messages for single recipients into the immediate 
directory.
